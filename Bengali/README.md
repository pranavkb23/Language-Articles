# Not Twins: How Bengali Differs from Hindi (and Where They Overlap)

**Author:** Pranav Kapoor Bhandari  
**Length:** ~850 words  
**Topic:** A clear, example-driven look at how Bengali (Bangla) diverges from Hindi—gender, verb morphology, copula/negation, classifiers, script/phonology—plus key similarities.

## Overview
This article argues that while Bengali and Hindi are related Indo-Aryan languages, they are structurally distinct. It highlights seven core differences (no gender in Bengali, six common person–honorific verb patterns, copula/negation behavior, classifiers, script and sound features, case/possession) and then notes major overlaps (SOV order, postpositions, shared roots).

## Key Examples (easy + IPA)
- **সে se** — "shay" (**/ʃe/**) vs. Hindi gender agreement (**acchā/acchī** — "uh-CHAA"/"uh-CHEE" (**/ət͡ʃːaː/**, **/ət͡ʃːiː/**))  
- **করা kôra** present forms: **kori/koro/korish/koren/kore** — "KOH-ree/roh/reesh/ren/reh" (**/kɔri, kɔro, kɔriʃ, kɔren, kɔre/**)  
- **negation:** **আমি যাই না ami jai na** — "AH-mee jai nah" (**/ami ʤai na/**) vs. **मैं नहीं जाता/जाती main nahī̃ jātā/jātī**  
- **classifiers:** **দুটি বই du-ṭeɪ boi**, **একজন মানুষ ek-jon manush**

## Takeaways
- **What’s happening:** Close relatives with crucial grammatical divergences (gender, endings, negation, classifiers).  
- **Why it matters:** Treating them as “the same” erases real learning effort and flattens distinct cultures.  
- **How to learn smarter:** Transfer shared SOV/postposition habits, but consciously retrain gender (Hindi) or classifier/negation patterns (Bengali).
