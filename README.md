# Mini Fieldwork Articles on Everyday Language

Short, example-driven essays by **me, Pranav Kapoor Bhandari** on patterns and phenomena I notice while speaking and studying **Hindi, English, Bengali, Spanish, and French**. These are **not formal linguistics papers**—they’re meant to be a **quick, fun read** with bite-size data, mini-fieldwork, and clear takeaways.

A recurring theme across the repo: I always include **how the phenomenon hits non-native speakers**, since Second-Language Learner experiences often diverge sharply from those of native speakers.

## What you’ll find in each article
- A **catchy hook**, **quick examples**, and a tidy **analysis → conclusion** flow.  
- **Dual pronunciations** whenever a non-English word appears:  
  - an **easy** English-ear guide in **quotes** (e.g., *mesa* → “may-sa”), and  
  - an **International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)** form in **parentheses** (e.g., (ˈmesa)).  
- Typical length **600–800 words** (occasionally **800–900** when a topic genuinely needs it).  
- A local `README.md` in each folder summarizing the content in each of the folder's articles.
